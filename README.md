# TastyPrinter
This python app connects to the mysql database for TastyIgniter using an API here: https://github.com/foximler/Tasty_Igniter_Api , prints off any new orders and then updates the status of the order. This is set to work with both an expo and kitchen printer over the network but the ESCPOS package also supports serial and usb if you wish to modify the order.
